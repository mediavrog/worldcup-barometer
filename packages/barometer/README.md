# Worldcup barometer

This app was created within a week using the MEAN.io stack.
I want to demonstrate my ability to
* dig into new technology (Angular, Mongo, Node.js, Express),
* evaluate it (looked at angular-bootstrap, MEAN.io, MEAN.js),
* timely implement a working prototype of a service (it could enhance the worldcup experience as second screen app),
* while trying to stick with best practices of the technology from the start (using directives, DI, $watch on scope variables, etc)

## Features
* build on MEAN.io stack template
* Sign in with Twitter
* Read tweets for match or for selected teams
* cheer for your favourite team
* see the cheers from other users (uses polling, should be replaced with server push (e. g. socket.io))

## ToDo
* add 'Booo' button
* use proper styling to make app responsive on mobile / tablet
* add tests
* add 'boo' button
* send automated tweet with statistics for support after each match from "Worldcup Barometer" twitter account
* add timeout to cheer button (2 secs?)
